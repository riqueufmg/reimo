<refactoring explanation>

The Extract Method technique was used to extract the method "findNextIndexOf" from the original method "nextIndexOf". The extracted method has a clear name and performs a single task, which is to find the next index of a given sequence in the buffer. The extracted method takes a CharSequence parameter and returns an int value. The original method calls the extracted method and returns its result.

The refactoring mechanics used in this case are:

1. Find a piece of code that does one clear task.
2. Note what variables it uses or changes.
3. Create a new method with a clear name.
4. Move the piece there, adding needed parameters and returns.
5. Replace the old chunk with a call to the new method.
6. Compile and Test to confirm it works the same.
