<refactoring explanation>

The original method is too long and complex. It performs two tasks: it scans the input sequence and finds the next instance of the sequence. It also handles surrogates.

To make the code more readable and maintainable, we can extract a new method that performs the first task: finding the next instance of the sequence. This method will be called from the original method.

The extracted method will have a clear name, such as "findNextIndexOf". It will take the input sequence and the starting position as parameters, and it will return the offset between the current position and the next instance of the input sequence.

The original method will call the extracted method and pass the input sequence and the starting position as parameters. The extracted method will return the offset between the current position and the next instance of the input sequence.

The extracted method will handle surrogates, but it will not handle the case where the input sequence is not found. The original method will handle this case by returning -1.
