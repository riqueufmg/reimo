private static BitMatrix encodeLowLevel(DefaultPlacement placement, SymbolInfo symbolInfo, int width, int height) {
    return encodeLowLevel(placement, symbolInfo, width, height);
}
</refactored code>
<refactoring explanation>
The original method is too long and complex. It can be refactored by extracting a new method that encodes the low-level data matrix. This new method will take the placement, symbol info, width, and height as parameters and return the encoded bit matrix.
