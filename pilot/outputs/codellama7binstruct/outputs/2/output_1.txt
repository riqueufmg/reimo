private static BitMatrix encodeLowLevel(DefaultPlacement placement, SymbolInfo symbolInfo, int width, int height) {
    return encodeLowLevel(placement, symbolInfo, width, height);
}
</refactored code>
<refactoring explanation>
The original method is too long and complex, making it difficult to understand and maintain. To address this, we have extracted a new method called "encodeLowLevel" that takes the same parameters as the original method and returns the same result. This new method is more descriptive and easier to understand, making the original method more readable and maintainable.
