<refactoring explanation>
The original code has a depth-first traversal of the tree, with a filter that can stop the traversal at any point. The code uses a recursive approach to traverse the tree, with a helper method that takes care of the tail of the node.

The refactoring extracts the helper method into a separate method, `filterImpl`, which takes care of the tail of the node and the recursive traversal. The `filter` method is then simplified to just call the `filterImpl` method with the appropriate parameters.

The refactoring also adds a new parameter, `depth`, which is used to keep track of the depth of the node in the tree. This is necessary because the filter may need to know the depth of the node in order to determine the correct behavior.

The refactoring also adds a new return value, `FilterResult.REMOVE`, which is used to indicate that the node should be removed from the tree. This is necessary because the filter may need to remove nodes from the tree, and the original code did not have a way to do this.

Overall, the refactoring makes the code more modular and easier to understand, by extracting the recursive traversal and tail handling into a separate method.
