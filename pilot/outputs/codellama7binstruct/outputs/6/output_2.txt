<refactoring explanation>

The original code has a recursive function that performs a depth-first traversal of a tree, and it uses a variable called "depth" to keep track of the current depth of the traversal. The function also uses a variable called "result" to keep track of the result of the filter, and it uses a variable called "node" to keep track of the current node being visited.

The refactoring extracts the recursive function into a separate method called "filter", and it adds a new parameter called "depth" to the method. The method returns the result of the filter, or {@link FilterResult#STOP} if the filter stops the traversal.

The original code has a loop that descends into child nodes, and it also has a loop that moves upwards through the tree. The refactoring extracts these loops into separate methods called "descend" and "moveUpwards", and it adds a new parameter called "depth" to these methods.

The refactoring also adds a new method called "tail" that is called when the traversal reaches the end of a node's children or siblings. This method is responsible for calling the "tail" method of the filter, and it also removes the current node if necessary.

The refactoring also adds a new method called "remove" that is called when the traversal reaches the end of a node's children or siblings, and it removes the current node.

The refactoring also adds a new method called "head" that is called when the traversal starts at the root node, and it is responsible for calling the "head" method of the filter.

The refactoring also adds a new method called "filter" that is called when the traversal starts at the root node, and it is responsible for calling the "filter" method of the filter.

The refactoring also adds a new method called "filter" that is called when the traversal starts at a child node, and it is responsible for calling the "filter" method of the filter.

The refactoring also adds a new method called "filter" that is called when the traversal starts at a sibling node, and it is responsible for calling the "filter" method of the filter.
