<refactoring explanation>
The code was refactored by extracting the method "getStartAddress" and moving it to the top of the method. The method was extracted from the original code and was given a new name "getStartAddress". The method was moved to the top of the method and was given the parameters "line" and "trimmedLine". The method was also given a return type of "String". The original code that called the method was also moved to the top of the method and was given the parameters "line" and "trimmedLine". The method was called and the result was assigned to the variable "possibleNativeAddress". The original code that called the method was also moved to the top of the method and was given the parameters "line" and "trimmedLine". The method was called and the result was assigned to the variable "possibleEntryAddress". The original code that called the method was also moved to the top of the method and was given the parameters "line". The method was called and the result was assigned to the variable "nativeAddress". The original code that called the method was also moved to the top of the method and was given the parameters "line". The method was called and the result was assigned to the variable "entryAddress". The original code that called the method was also moved to the top of the method and was given the parameters "line". The method was called and the result was assigned to the variable "previousLine".
