<refactoring explanation>
The code was refactored by extracting the logic of ensuring the meta charset element into a separate method. This method is now called from the original method and takes care of updating the meta charset element.

The original method was refactored by extracting the logic of ensuring the meta charset element into a separate method. This method is now called from the original method and takes care of updating the meta charset element.
