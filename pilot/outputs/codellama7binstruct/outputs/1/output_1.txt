<refactoring explanation>
The original code has a long sequence of nested loops that add edges to the graph and then find the minimal result. To make the code more readable and maintainable, we have extracted a new method called "getMinimalResult" that takes the edges and the input length as parameters and returns the minimal result. This method is called from the original method after the edges have been added.

The extracted method has a clear name and a single responsibility, which makes it easier to understand and maintain. It also reduces the complexity of the original method, making it easier to read and understand.

The refactoring has also improved the code's performance, as the minimal result is now computed only once, instead of multiple times in the original code.
