<refactoring explanation>
In this refactoring, we have extracted a method called "getMinimalResult" from the original method "encodeMinimally". The extracted method takes two parameters: "edges" and "inputLength". The method returns a Result object, which is created by analyzing the "edges" array and finding the minimal result.

The original method "encodeMinimally" is now simpler and easier to understand, as it only focuses on setting up the "edges" array and calling the extracted method.

The extracted method "getMinimalResult" is a more focused method that only cares about finding the minimal result, and it can be reused in other parts of the codebase if needed.

Overall, this refactoring improves the readability and maintainability of the code, as it makes it easier to understand the logic of the method and reduces the complexity of the code.
